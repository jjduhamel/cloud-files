# Cloud Scripts

This repository contains scripts that I use for deploying stuff to the cloud.  In most cases, these won't be escpecially useful for others.  However, I decided to make this repository since it may contain useful reference code.

* cloud-scripts
  * ami: Packer scripts for AMI's that I use
  * beanstalk: Dockerrun files for elastic beanstalk.
  * docker: Dockerfiles for my apps.
  * infra: Terraform scripts.

These are released under GPLv3.  You're welcome to use these scripts for any purpose without giving me credit.  If you do find anything here useful, I always appreciate hearing about it.  :)
